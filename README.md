# ESLint: Checking for Syntax and Logic Errors
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course [ESLint: Checking for Syntax and Logic Errors]. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning][lil-course-url].

![ESLint: Checking for Syntax and Logic Errors][lil-thumbnail-url] 

Reduce bugs and boost efficiency by using ESLint to catch common coding errors. In this course—the third and final installment in the ESLint series—learn about some of the most essential error-catching rules in ESLint, as well as how to configure them. Instructor Sasha Vodnik details how to configure rules to identify errors in code for functions; configure ESLint to identify issues with loops and in conditional structures; enable error checking for logic errors in for and if-else statements; identify empty blocks and unneeded debugging statements; alert you to sparse arrays and strings that seem to use template literal syntax; and catch common logic errors. Plus, Sasha provides a challenge that allows you to put your new skills to the test.

### Skills covered in this course
 - Web Development
 - Debugging Code
 - ESLint

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Folders
The files are divided into two folders, which represent 2 separate projects:
  - The `ErrorChecking` folder contains the project used in videos `01_01` through `01_06`.
  - The `Challenge` folder contains the project used in videos `01_07` and `01_08`.

## Installing
